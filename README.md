# Visualizr Prototype

This repository contains the original prototype of Visualizr, my visual database designer. It has been forked into a private repository for further development and exists as a public archive for my portfolio.

The ***Design*** was inpired by a post on Dribbble but I've lost the link and it's ***powered by*** React Flow, coded in TypeScript, and wrapped in Next 13 for simplicity but does not use any of its APIs. Boards are ***saved*** via the `localStorage` API under `reactflow`.
